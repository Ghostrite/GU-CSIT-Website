This will install all the required dependencies for the project. After that, you can run `node index.js` to run the website locally on your machine. by default the website is hosted on http://localhost:3000

***Note: You will not need to install MongoDB on your machine for this project to run as the database used by this website is hosted on the cloud. Another thing to note is that you might run into a version error while trying to run the website. This is caused by the becrypt module and can be solved by using the command `npm install becrypt` independently.***
